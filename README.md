# Blackout Rugby

This is the ember.js app for Blackout Rugby. The live app can be found at https://v2.blackoutrugby.com.

Be warned that this version is in development, so changes are being made often, and direct to Master (for now) so may break your local copy.

If you have any trouble or just want to chat feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@blackoutrugby.com). We'd love to hear from anyone interested in developing for Blackout Rugby.

## Ember 101
